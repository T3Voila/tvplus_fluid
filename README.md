# TV+ Fluid Renderer

<img alt="ICON" align="right" width="256" height="256" src="/Resources/Public/Icons/Extension.svg">

This is a [TYPO3](https://typo3.org) Extension which extends your TemplaVoilà! Plus installation with support for the modern TYPO3.Fluid template engine as renderer for frontend output.

Take a look into the [UIkit theme](https://github.com/T3Voila/t3voila_uikit) to learn how to use the TV+ Fluid Renderer inside your theme extension.

## Installation

The extension supports following TYPO3 LTS versions:
* TYPO3 v8 LTS
* TYPO3 v9 LTS
* TYPO3 v10 LTS
* TYPO3 v11 LTS
* TYPO3 v12 LTS

On composer based TYPO3 instances install the extension with the following command:

```bash
composer require t3voila/tvplus-fluid
```

On TER based TYPO3 instances go to the extension modul and search for tvplus_fluid and use the install button.

## Future of this extension

This extension will later be merged into "TemplaVoilà! Plus v10" as primary renderer. So you can use this extension already to switch from XPath rendering to Fluid rendering.
